# EDGE: Elastic Data-Driven Encoding for GWAS

Flexibly encoded genome-wide association study identifies novel nonadditive genetic risk variants for cardiometabolic traits

## Overview

EDGE (Elastic Data-Driven Encoding) is a novel method for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that determines the inheritance model each SNP contributes to a given trait, allowing for unique and flexible SNP encoding. Unlike traditional GWAS that assume an additive inheritance model, EDGE can identify nonadditive effects, including dominant and recessive patterns.

## Background

Most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) assume an additive inheritance model, which assigns heterozygous genotypes half the risk of homozygous-alternate genotypes. This has led to a focus on additive genetic effects in complex disease research. Growing evidence indicates that many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have nonadditive effects, including dominant and recessive effects, which are missed by the additive model alone.

## Applications

EDGE GWAS analysis identified nonadditive inheritance patterns for more than 52% of genome-wide significant loci for:
- Coronary artery disease (CAD)
- Body mass index (BMI)

This research:
- Identifies novel disease-risk SNPs missed by traditional additive models
- May improve polygenic risk prediction in diverse populations
- Provides a framework for future applications to thousands of disease phenotypes
